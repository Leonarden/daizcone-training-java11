#CHAPTER: 8. Functional Style Programming - Fundamentals and Design Patterns

##Problems
*Use the following problems to test your functional style programming prowess. I strongly encourage you to give each problem a try before you turn to the solutions and download the example programs:

p166. Writing functional interfaces: Write a program to define the road from 0 to a functional interface via a set of meaningful examples.

p167.  Lambdas in a nutshell: Explain what a lambda expression is.

p168. Implementing the Execute Around pattern: Write a program that represents an implementation of the Execute Around pattern based on lambdas.

p169. Implementing the Factory pattern: Write a program that represents an implementation of the Factory pattern based on lambdas.

p170. Implementing the Strategy pattern: Write a program that represents an implementation of the Strategy pattern based on lambdas.

p171. Implementing the Template Method pattern: Write a program that represents an implementation of the Template Method pattern based on lambdas.

p172. Implementing the Observer pattern: Write a program that represents an implementation of the Observer pattern based on lambdas.

p173. Implementing the Loan pattern: Write a program that represents an implementation of the Loan pattern based on lambdas.

p174. Implementing the Decorator pattern: Write a program that represents an implementation of the Decorator pattern based on lambdas.

p175. Implementing the Cascaded Builder pattern: Write a program that represents an implementation of the Cascaded Builder pattern based on lambdas.
